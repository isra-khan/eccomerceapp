# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - assets/images/
     - assets/icons/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: Nunito
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito-Light.ttf
           weight: 300
         - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito-Regular.ttf
           weight: 400
         - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito-Italic.ttf
           style: italic
         - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito-Medium.ttf
           weight: 500
         - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito-MediumItalic.ttf
           weight: 500
           style: italic
         - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito-SemiBold.ttf
           weight: 600
         - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito-Bold.ttf
           weight: 800
